Amazing place to grow and develop,"Sep 26, 2021 ",5.0,Former, Senior Management Consultant,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"Focused a lot of early career development. Amazing place to grow your strategic thinking, problem solving, and quantitative skills.","Long hours, but honestly, not deal-breaking."
It's luck of the draw,"Sep 27, 2021 ",3.0,Current, International Tax Associate,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"The people, you will gain a ton of experience at a very fast rate, flexible working hours, work from home / hybrid environment, and is a job that constantly challenges you.","Although the hours are flexible they are still ridiculously long and it creates a lot of difficulty in disconnecting from work and maintaining other aspects of your life. If you don't mind work significantly more than 40 hrs (easily 60+ during busy season) each week , as well as never knowing when you're going to be done with work each day then it will likely be a decent fit, but otherwise maybe look for something else."
Lots of politics,"Sep 28, 2021 ",4.0,Former, SAP Consultant,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"Opportunity to work with lots of bright talented people, general prestige of the firm",Very negative experience with a manager with zero people management skills. Did not know how to constructively offer feedback and instead just chose to belittle any mistakes we made.
Its a massive ship,"Sep 30, 2021 ",3.0,Former, International Tax Associate,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"They are trying to change culture, and you can find people that care.",They are still a business and you are replaceable. So being burnt out did not matter. Getting sleep or having your life continuously interrupted did not matter. A partner has his first child on Friday and was back in the office on Monday and never took paternity leave. Not exactly setting the best example here.
PwC life,"Sep 21, 2021 ",4.0,Current, Risk and Regulatory Advisory Senior Associate,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,Good pay and benefits Career opportunities are plentiful and people work with you well to progress you,You work a lot. The firm preaches work life balance but it is all just for show as no one really follows it. The firm also took a woke new approach to people and it is annoying a lot of people that are afraid to speak up against it.
"Politics, politics and more politics","Aug 1, 2021 ",3.0,Current, Recruiter,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"Amazing benefits and decent PTO policy. Allows work from home (even prior to Covid)). Some really nice, decent people, but they don’t stay long.","Politics rule at PwC. Hard work? Doesn’t matter. Masters Degree? Doesn’t matter. They pride themselves of D&I initiatives but at the end of the day it’s all about which clique you’re in with and who you know. I’ve seen qualified candidates not get a chance bc the job went to someone who had a connection within the firm. Promotions are given based on politics and work ethic and results have zero to do with anything. It’s sad because I think PwC truly could be the great place to work for that they claim to be, but promoting based on politics is just going to continue to hurt while other firms pass us by."
Conservative legacy accounting firm trying to be a TechCo,"Aug 8, 2021 ",3.0,Former, Alliance Customer Relationship Executive (ACRE),,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"Big clients that believe in PwC, excellent values at the top, good benefits, good reputation, strong negotiating leverage to bring all the major vendors to the table.","The firm's reputation is good, but everything moves at a snail's pace, and neither the client experience or the work output on technical projects measure up to the firm's illustrious reputation. PwC isn't really built for tech or sales -- or even advisory consulting, really, because they're just not fast enough to keep up with what's really going on. It will always be an accounting firm first, but they REALLY want to be a tech and consulting company. For what it's worth, during my tenure, I worked with people that had just come from similar firms like Deloitte and Accenture, and all of these cons seem to apply to those firms too. They're all trying to be something that they aren't because they think it will help their bottom lines and reputations."
People Friendly Firm,"Sep 25, 2021 ",5.0,Former, Partner,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"The firm provides a focus on providing opportunities to develop all employees, provide career growth options and work life balance alternatives",During the busy season it can be very long demanding days

You learn great skills and really grow. Good benefits, when you have the time to take them If you take the summer after graduation to knock as many CPA exams out as you can, they pay for your CPA and CPA bonus","The rest is a personal rant on poor work life balance; read or skip if you'd like. Busy season(s) working 55-65+hours per week - those have been some of the hardest times of my life. Often having to do trainings on evenings or weekends, inventory counts a few times a year on weekends or holidays. Be prepared to work part-time and full-time on weekends during busy season(s). If you're lucky those busy season(s) will only last 2-3 months a year. It can still feel a bit busy the rest of the year I don't know how anyone studies for the CPA without knocking out exams before starting full time. Getting promoted appears to bring even less work-life balance I'm worried about my family not having a spouse/ parent during busy season, to say nothing of other priorities"

Great stepping stone.

I personally don't feel passionate enough to be doing this long term. If IT audit and checking boxes is your cup of tea you'll enjoy. And staff is helpful if you need help. Great project management experience.,Work life balance could be better. Constantly have to manage offshore teams during your evenings to make sure they understand and get the work done. And every engagement expects this. Hence turnover rate is high because pressure to meet deadlines and manage multiple offshore teams for multiple clients gets tough. And obviously you still have your work which needs to get done with all the project management.

So most top rate people got a 2 instead of 1 in rating. I only got a 1 rating when I moved to a specialist role working for the same eng teams. They have been doing rounds of layoffs of admin staff every few years - they're looking to do business without admin staff whenever possible.

It's a very high-pressure environment that is not meant for everyone. Each year, if you perform well, you're given more work the next year with the same amount of time to complete the work, even though the work hasn't gotten any more manageable due to the variability of client data/timing, etc. The firm also has aimed to hire less in order to leverage offshore resources and technology, but sometimes the equation does not work and you end up very short staffed with even more work than the prior year. Sometimes it feels like a zero-sum game because in order to make some projects' deliverables higher quality, others have to suffer, or, worse, you have to give up more of your precious personal time, which is already limited because of the expected overtime."

The firm itself has great quality resources in the form of overseas support and a data analytics practice along with an endless array of technology resources.","The deals practice does not do enough to prioritize the development for junior staff levels. Experience is largely determined based on staffing which typically is a highly subjective exercise. Promotional times vary and can be significantly influenced by these previously mentioned staffing arrangements along with local office politics. Often times this leads to associates that started in the group with significantly stronger capabilities than lateral seniors or managers. Pay is significantly below other groups. In regard to this issue, leadership always sidestepped any questions in this area from my experiences."

Burnout,"Aug 24, 2021 ",1.0,Former, Assurance Associate,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,Working at the firm certainly boosts your resume.,"The burnout I experienced working at PwC was second to none. During busy season, my team and I got to the office around 8 am and did not leave until 10 PM or later. Being chained to a desk for this long had a extremely negative impact on my mental health. To make matters worse the pay is dismal. The $52K a year associates are paid amounted to less than minimum wage on a per-hour basis with the amount we were working. The fact that at the end of the audit, your work goes into a file to never see the light of day again is extremely demoralizing. In this role, you never have the chance to work on skills such as leadership or public speaking, or really be client facing at all. Upon leaving PwC - I secured an immediate 33% raise to work less, on work that I feel matters and contributes to my development as a professional. My advice - do not be swayed by the wining and dining, Disneyland trips, and shadow days that you get as an intern. Take into account the effect that this job could have on your mental health. If you feel you are not liking the role, it will not get better with time, it will get worse. Prioritize yourself and get out. Every job is going to have it's ""stuff"" and other finance jobs are by no means easy, month end times get busy and due dates still exist. But this is NOTHING compared to the workload this company puts on you. The grass really is greener on the other side."

It's a high-performance culture but the competition and fast-moving nature of work allows you to learn a lot in a short amount of time. Promotions are usually merit-based and L&D tools and technologies are top of line.

It's interesting work, more so than audit (where I transferred from), and keeps me engaged most of the day.","The hours are outrageous and people at higher ranks truly do not know when to stop working. Especially in a WFH environment, people are seemingly encouraged to be available at all hours of the day, which typically results in me working 14 hours a day. I think the culture at PwC is quite work-obsessed and they truly do a terrible job of ACTUALLY letting you have work-life balance. I have been asked to help out while on vacation before, have been pinged over the weekend when I was not planning on working, and have generally just felt quite tossed around by my higher ups at PwC, with very little to say about it. I would also argue that the company does not care about my mental health whatsoever. I was falsely encouraged to be comfortable talking about mental health in the team setting, but after requesting time off for my mental health, I received feedback in my performance review knocking me down a few points because my team was impacted by my request to step away for a bit to regain some of my sanity. At PwC, I hear a lot of empty words preached to the firm about mental health, but at the end of the day all the firm cares about is sucking the most out of you as possible."

Staying past 3AM on several occasions each year is to be expected. Considering the amount of time spent working, pay is very low. The tediousness of much of the work, and the long lengths of time spent doing it make it difficult to stay motivated . Eating hours- Management will say in more public announcements that they would never tell anyone to eat their hours. While this is technically true, they will also assign a workload that no human could possibly complete within the time they budget for it. So, yes, you can report the actual number of hours works and then me reprimanded for ""inefficiency."" In reality, it is ubiquitous for employees to eat tons of hours. There is a common misconception that there is one busy season (typically Jan-Mar) that is followed by a relatively tame schedule the rest of the year. Maybe this was true in the past, but it's the opposite of true now. When you work on 4 clients per year, the majority of the year is ""busy season."" No bonuses at associate level. Instead, at the end of the traditional winter busy season, a ""gift"" is given to staff. The gist is typically like a $10 trinket."

Personally, I have dyslexia (still a high performer) but when I reached out to HR for resources (proofreading software, connecting to a diverse group, and changing my coach) they were very toned def and I was the first person in my market to do so. After creating partner relationships, advocating, and openly discussing this disability the firm is slowing starting to handle this better. The hours are also insane and very understaffed.

Similar to investment banking but without the pay. Some offices had to increase pay of junior staff as it breach slavery acts in Europe. - Not given time to study but require the qualification to work there. - You will live and breath this firm. - Worst people culture of the big 4 Houston, Tx office: I worked at few offices and can say that PwC Houston has the worst, most toxic atmosphere I have ever experienced. White men club is an understatement. The overbearing masculine and sexist energy on the team is suffocating. As a woman you are constantly talked over, ignored and pushed aside. When I tried to raise the issue I was made to feel like the problem. People who move from other offices are given 0 support and expected to know everything about the new client, new team etc straight away. I asked for trainings or courses I could do in my own time but there were none. I had a number of friends move offices with EY and KPMG and they received a lot more logistical and financial support for the move and then trainings in the office. My time at the Houston office was my worse at PwC which is a shame."

Good first job,"Mar 10, 2021 ",3.0,Former, Senior Assurance Associate,,Recommend,Business Outlook,Share,"1. Easy entry to associate level roles especially if you come from campus recruitment. 2. Great reality check on getting used to the number of hours people work in accounting/finance as you’ll be working 9-3am at least a few times a year (which is normal even on the client side). It’s just the nature of this actg field. 3. Culture is great. Everyone is on board with the millennial corporate culture. No one will ever embarrass you or others for being bad at your job. Overall, everyone is very nice and willing to help. Even if they truly don’t want to help, everyone is obligated to help because it’s just the culture at this firm. 4. Flexibility - the transfer process is super easy if you know the right people. I’ve been able to work in different service lines as a result. 5. Promotion is pretty much guaranteed and timeline based. You put in the number of years and you’ll get it. You wouldn’t be held back from a promotion unless people absolutely hate you or you’re so bad at the job that you literally can’t be promoted. From what I’ve seen, you can be average and still get promoted even at the manager level. It’s all a seniority game at the end of the day.","1. The firm constantly tries to adopt new changes which creates inefficiencies and zero value add. It all seems more for marketing purposes than for actual enhancements to the day to day job. 2. Too many firm initiatives that are just for show rather than practice. For example, “be well work well, stop the grind” slogan has been tossed around the firm for the last year or so but I haven’t seen anyone actually “stop the grind.” People are consistently working every minute of the day and will get pings during their vacation time. It’s just the nature of the job as this is a client service field. 3. I don’t think the work necessarily translates well into industry as this is a client service field where companies come here to buy specific services that they do not want to do or have enough human bodies to crank out. The longer you stay the harder it will be to exit this field unless you’re set you want to be here for 10+ years (which might not be bad)."

Never before did I imagine I could work 16 hours straight for 30+ days (and that wasn't even busy season). Before COVID, the happy hours and company-sponsored parties and events were great. There's a set career path and clear milestones. I believe that senior management really does care about humanity on a macro scale. The people who work there are generally cool people.","People above you are stressed, and so they take it out on you. The compensation is not high enough for the amount of work you are required to do. There is a huge push towards automation, except that all the time-savings due to technology are not passed on to the audit team, rather they are used to squeeze even more value and effort out of the team. As long as the bottom line is the focus, the human capital is going to become more and more drained and exhausted. The working hours are insane. The toll on your mental health. The toll on your physical health. Some managers are stressed and angry, and they take it out on you, and it can be a very toxic work environment. I could go on but it would be getting repetitive."
